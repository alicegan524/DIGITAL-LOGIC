# DIGITAL-LOGIC
Digital Logic is closely connected to Computer Science because it forms the foundation of how computers work. Concepts such as Boolean logic and logic gates explain how data is processed at the hardware level, while Computer Science builds on these ideas to develop software and algorithms. Learning digital logic has helped me better understand how high-level code is ultimately executed by the computer.

## [Lab 1](https://github.com/alicegan524/DIGITAL-LOGIC/blob/main/DL%20LAB%201.pdf)
In the combinational logic lab, I learned how to build and test digital circuits using logic gates. The lab helped me apply the theory from class, like designing circuits with AND, OR, and NOT gates, and simplifying them with Boolean algebra. Some circuits were tricky at first, but following the steps carefully and testing each part made it easier to understand. This lab improved my practical skills and helped me see how combinational logic works in real circuits.

## [Lab 2](https://github.com/alicegan524/DIGITAL-LOGIC/blob/main/DL%20LAB%202.pdf)
In this lab, I used the Deeds Simulator to design and simulate combinational digital circuits. It helped me apply what I learned in class, like using logic gates to create circuits and checking their outputs. Simulating the circuits made it easier to see how they worked and to find mistakes quickly. At first, some designs were tricky, but testing step by step improved my understanding. Overall, this lab helped me learn both the theory and practical skills for designing digital circuits.

## [Quiz 1](https://github.com/alicegan524/DIGITAL-LOGIC/blob/main/DL%20QUIZ%201.pdf)
The digital logic quiz helped me understand how computers work. I practiced converting numbers between binary, decimal, octal, and hexadecimal, and learned more about codes like ASCII and BCD. The quiz made me more confident with digital logic and number systems.
