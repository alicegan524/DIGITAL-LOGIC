# DIGITAL-LOGIC
Digital Logic is closely connected to Computer Science because it forms the foundation of how computers work. Concepts such as Boolean logic and logic gates explain how data is processed at the hardware level, while Computer Science builds on these ideas to develop software and algorithms. Learning digital logic has helped me better understand how high-level code is ultimately executed by the computer.
